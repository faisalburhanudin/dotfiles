# Git Add-Commit-Push Command

Complete git workflow: add files, create commit, and push to remote in one command.

## Usage
- Add all changes, commit with message, and push to remote

## Instructions
1. Check git status to see what files have changed
2. Add appropriate files to staging (avoid logs, build artifacts, temp files)
3. Review staged changes with git diff --staged
4. Check recent commit messages for style consistency
5. Create commit with descriptive message following project conventions
6. Push commits to remote repository

## Safety Checks
- Review what files are being added before staging
- Confirm staged changes before committing
- Verify commits before pushing to remote
- Check branch status and tracking

IMPORTANT: Never add Co-Authored-By tags or any similar attribution to Claude in commits. Keep commits clean and professional.

Always be selective about what you add - don't add unnecessary files like logs, build artifacts, or temporary files. Be careful with force pushes - only use when necessary and you understand the implications.
